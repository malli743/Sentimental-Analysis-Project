# Sentiment Analysis of Restaurant Reviews

## Project Overview

This project performs sentiment analysis on restaurant reviews using Natural Language Processing (NLP) and Machine Learning (ML) techniques. The main goal is to classify customer reviews as either positive or negative to help businesses understand customer opinions.

## Features

* Text data preprocessing and cleaning
* Sentiment classification using machine learning models like Logistic Regression and Naive Bayes
* Visualization of sentiment distribution
* Simple and easy-to-understand code structure for learning and experimentation

## Technologies Used

* Python
* Pandas, NumPy
* NLTK or spaCy
* Scikit-learn
* Matplotlib, Seaborn

## How to Run

1. Clone the repository:

   ```
   git clone https://github.com/malli743/Sentimental-Analysis-Project.git
   cd Sentimental-Analysis-Project
   ```

2. Install the required dependencies:

   ```
   pip install -r requirements.txt
   ```

3. Open the Jupyter Notebook:

   ```
   jupyter notebook
   ```

   Then open `Sentiment_Analysis _code.ipynb` and run each cell step by step.

## Sample Results

Example prediction distribution after training the model:

* Positive: 75%
* Negative: 25%

## Learnings

* Gained practical experience with NLP preprocessing techniques like tokenization, stopword removal, and lemmatization
* Applied and compared multiple ML classification algorithms
* Developed a better understanding of how to approach real-world sentiment classification tasks using machine learning
